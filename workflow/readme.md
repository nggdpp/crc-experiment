The overall process for this experiment is described in the main readme at the root. This readme lists the specific workflow steps as links to the Jupyter Notebooks containing their code and discussion.

1. [Prep Raw Data.ipynb](Prep Raw Data.ipynb) - Pulls the data downloads from the CRC Well Catalog web app, adds values for later processing, and loads them as collections in MongoDB
2. [Pull MapServer Information.ipynb](Pull MapServer Information.ipynb) - Pages through queries of the MapServer layer query services for the two collections and caches the features with linked identifiers in MongoDB for later processing
3. [Scrape CRC Web Pages.ipynb](Scrape CRC Web Pages.ipynb) - Uses the assembled identifiers from the MapServer layers to create URLs to landing pages, sets these up in a collection for processing, scrapes data structures from the pages, and caches the results in MongoDB for later processing
4. [Geologic Map Unit Context.ipynb](Geologic Map Unit Context.ipynb) - Prepares a collection of unique geohashed coordinates, runs queries against a Macrostrat API, and caches the results in the collection for later processing
5. [cores_aggregation.js](cores_aggregation.js) and [cuttings_aggregation.js](cuttings_aggregation.js) - Used via a MongoDB console connection to generate "cores" and "cuttings" collections containing combination of properties from raw data, scraped data, and GMU contextual data
6. [Build SB Items.ipynb](Build SB Items.ipynb) - uses the final collections for cores and cuttings with functions from [sbitem_from_crcrecord.py](sbitem_from_crcrecord.py) to build ScienceBase Items and loads them to ScienceBase

At the end of this processing, all collections from MongoDB were exported using MongoDB functions to a collection of JSON document arrays and gzipped for inclusion in the project. These datasets are considered intermediaries and not really the point of this project, but they are included for reference and can be read by anything capable of consuming JSON arrayed documents. The actual final product from these processing steps are the collection items in the following two ScienceBase Collections of the National Digital Catalog.

* [USGS Core Research Center (CRC) Collection of Core](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e49dae4b07f02db5e0486)
* [USGS Core Research Center (CRC) Collection of Cuttings](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e49d8e4b07f02db5df2d2)
